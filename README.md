# Unsupervised Learning Methods with R
To demonstrate my experience with unsupervised machine learning techniques, I developed a series of mini-projects highlighting my ability to uncover patterns and structure within unlabeled data.

Skills:

Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Dimensionality Reduction

Dataset: 

Varies by project

Methodology:
- Preprocess data and perform exploratory data analysis
- Apply unsupervised machine learning technique(s)
- Evaluate results through interpretation and visualization

Tools & Technologies:
- Programming Language: R
- Libraries: ggplot2, cluster, fossil, igraph, Rgraphviz, corrplot, glasso, arules, rpart, recommenderlab, fpc, factoextra, kohonen, bnlearn
- Software: RStudio, Markdown

Challenges & Learning:

Unsupervised learning is particularly challenging due to the absence of labeled outputs like accuracy or loss scores. Through these mini-projects, I developed the ability to identify meaningful patterns and relationships in data without direct feedback. I also significantly improved my skills in communicating results through thoughtful visualizations and well-structured reporting.
