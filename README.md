# Unsupervised Learning Methods with R
To demonstrate my skills with unsupervised machine learning techniques, I have created this series of mini-projects highlighting my experience.

Skills:

Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, Data Mining

Dataset: 

Varies by project

Methodology:
- Preprocess data and perform exploratory data analysis
- Apply machine learning technique(s)
- Evaluate and visualize results

Tools & Technologies:
- Programming Language: R
- Libraries: ggplot2, cluster, fossil, igraph, Rgraphviz, corrplot, glasso, arules, rpart, recommenderlab, fpc, factoextra, kohonen, bnlearn
- Software: R-Studio, Markdown

Challenges & Learning:

Unsupervised learning presents its biggest challenge by not being able to directly see results such as accuracy or loss scores. Through these mini-projects, I learned to identify patterns and trends in data. Also, I significantly improved my skills in the write-up or reporting aspect to clearly discuss the results shown.
